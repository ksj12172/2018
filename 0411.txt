This is a test for starting git and github.
I'm learning how to use git and github by 'Introduction - Git and GitHub for Poets' posted by 'The Coding Train .
I want to finish this homework today!
I made a new branch, 'tea-pot'. 
And then, I made a new branch, 'peter-pepper'.
I use merge request also, but I failed.
Therefore I edited my file '0411.txt'
This time, I'm gonna learn Forks and Pull Requests for our deep learning project.
